Added ability for user to give input
Added feature that saves input and timestamp under current date

Showed code to chatGPT, it recommended the following changes that were implemented
    -Encapsulate functions
    -Add error handling
    -use fstrings for modifying strings instead of the silly stuff I was doing earlier
    -Other small best practice changes

Next steps....
-Convert from text to working with JSON to allow for scalability and ability to work with NLM
-Add feature that allows user to specify their timezone (or if lazy just use UTC time for now)
