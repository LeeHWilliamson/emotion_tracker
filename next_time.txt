Added ability for user to give input
Added feature that saves input and timestamp under current date

Showed code to chatGPT, it recommended the following changes that were implemented
    -Encapsulate functions
    -Add error handling
    -use fstrings for modifying strings instead of the silly stuff I was doing earlier
    -Other small best practice changes

Next steps....
-Convert from text to working with JSON to allow for scalability and ability to work with NLM
-Add feature that allows user to specify their timezone (or if lazy just use UTC time for now)

I have converted from text to JSON. Next I will implement the emotion labeler
First I think I should set up a virtual environment so I can work on this on my laptop as well. I will use Docker because it is a good tool to learn
Will need docker image that supports tensorflow and an AMD GPU
This weekend I need to set up docker image for this project and follow emotion label tutorial
